# Peppernote

##Introduction
Peppernote is an opensource project for creating and synchronizing notes over various platforms.
Project should consist of Web server application and client applications for various platforms.
Current Web server is implemented in Rails and provides REST API for client-server communication.

##Current state
Web application is curently running on Heroku: https://peppernote.herokuapp.com  
Android application is being developed and should be available soon.  
REST API Documentation is coming soon.  

##Inspiration
Peppernote came out of an idea to create fully opensource note synchronizing tool including server side.
Project should be an alternative to current proprietary tools. It is being developed as my bachelor's thesis.
